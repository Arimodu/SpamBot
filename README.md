# SpamBot
### Usage:
Download SpamBot.py and one (or more) .txt files. Then just rename the file of choice to MessageFile.txt and then run the python script. When the "spamming in 5" appears, you have 5 seconds to choose the window and messagebox you want to spam. This was made for discord, so it presses enter automatically.
